Chapter 2: Attributes of Distributed Systems

 
So, we understand the what and the why of system design. We know we're focusing on High-Level Design for distributed systems.

But this raises a critical question: What makes a distributed system good? What are the actual goals we are designing for?

In a single, simple application, success might be 'it works.' But in a distributed world, 'working' isn't enough. The system must work when millions of users hit it at once. It must work when a critical server catches fire. It must work for a user halfway across the globe. And it must continue to work as our team constantly changes and improves it.

These aren't nice-to-haves. They are the non-functional requirements that become our primary design drivers. They are the qualities we measure, argue about, and optimize for in every architecture meeting.

To design effectively, we need a shared vocabulary for these qualities. We need to define what we mean by a system that is robust, fast, and future-proof.

This brings us to the core Attributes of Distributed Systems. Think of these not as a checklist, but as a framework for thought—a set of interconnected, and sometimes competing, goals that will guide every single decision we make from here on out.

We Will understand how these distributed system attributes come into a play when we  think about designing a distributed system. we may need to make appropriate trade-off among these attributes to satisfy the system requirements.

In this chapter, we will build this vocabulary by covering the following foundational concepts:

1. Communication (The fundamental challenge: how components talk)

2. Consistency (Everyone sees the same data at the same time)

3. Availability (Can you get a response, even if it's stale?)

4. Reliability (Does the system behave correctly over time?)

5. Fault Tolerance (How it achieves reliability despite failures)

6. Scalability (How it handles increased load)

7. Durability (The guarantee that your data must persist and not be lost)

8. Maintainability (How we manage the system's evolution)
